            "Great design often starts with a spark. It could be a color, a material or even a feeling of what you want your life to be like at home. And that initial inspiration is different for everyone. But if you’re looking for ideas to start a home renovation or new-build project in 2022 or beyond, this roundup of trends will provide plenty of ignition.",
            "1. Multiple Window Banks",
            "Many homeowners dream of light and bright kitchens. One way to get that is with plenty of windows that let the natural light stream in. Long banks of multiple windows, sometimes on two or even three walls, create a space full of light, fresh air — if the windows are operable — and views. Thanks to the rise of hardworking pantry walls, storage-optimized island bases and lower cabinets that allow homeowners to skip upper cabinets, we anticipate homeowners will go with expansive runs of windows in 2022.",
            "2. Casual Collected Look",
            "A dressed-up, collected style caught on last year, but for 2022 a more casual, less-polished approach looks to be taking hold.",
            "The look features softer, lighter paint colors, raw wood tones and a mix of cabinet fronts and styles. This light, layered design keeps the eye moving, provides visual texture and nuance and delivers a style that appears put together over time in a relaxed way.",
            "3. Islands",
            "The kitchen island has been rising in popularity for years but has practically become ubiquitous lately. If the kitchen is the hub of the home, then consider the island the hub of the hub of the home.",
            "Many homeowners are working with design and remodeling professionals to rejigger layouts to fit an island, large or small. Plus, kitchen islands seem to be taking on more duties these days. In addition to providing extra counter space and storage, many now include the dishwasher, trash pullout, prep sink and seating.",
            "4. Appliances in Islands",
            "Speaking of islands, another trend we’re seeing is homeowners choosing to locate a beverage fridge on an island end. This allows guests and family members to grab a drink without getting in the way of the cook. A microwave on an island near an end can solve the same issue, letting someone heat up a drink or snack without blocking the main traffic area.",
            "5. Hardworking Kitchen Storage",
            "The right storage strategies can create a highly functional home. And while the general function of cabinetry hasn’t changed much over the years, the inside of cabinets has dramatically shifted. Pullouts bring pantry items from the back of cabinets to the front. Special shelves lift heavy appliances from a lower cabinet to countertop height. Drawer dividers organize plates and bowls. You can now have designated storage space for a paper towel roll, or aluminum foil, baking sheets or almost anything else you can think of."
